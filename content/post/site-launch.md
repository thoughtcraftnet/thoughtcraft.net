This first post officially kicks off the **thoughtcraft** website, my home for sharing knowledge, tech tips, and random musings.

I've been meaning to publish more writing for a *long time*.  What finally got me moving?  A discussion with a buddy on accountability along with a friendly follow up wager. ðŸ˜…

While short, this post serves three purposes:
1. It helps me to *break inertia* by putting something out into the world.
1. It provides the opportunity to work through any initial hiccups with deployment tooling.
1. It means I'm not on the hook for a steak dinner (another time, [Stephen](https://github.com/cookincode)!)
